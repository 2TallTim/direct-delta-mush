# Direct Delta Mush

This is an implementation of the research paper "Direct Delta Mush Skinning and Variants" as a Maya MPxSkinCluster deformer. More information can be found [here](https://www.ea.com/seed/news/siggraph2019-direct-delta-mush).

The plugin requires [IGL](https://libigl.github.io/) and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) to build. It has not been tested on anything other than Windows & Maya 2019. Contributions welcomed.
